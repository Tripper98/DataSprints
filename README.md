Hi dear team, 
In this file, You'll find : 

  - How to set up the environment ? 
  - How to run Data Scientist Test ? 

In this test, I worked with [python 3.7.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-377/).

## 1. Set up the environment : 
- You'll find documentation Here : [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)
- After installing it, open anaconda prompt and create an environment namely DTest: 
```sh
$ conda create --name DTest
```
- go to the directory Test
- Activate The DTest environment
```sh
$ cd Test
$ conda activate DTest
```
- Open an other terminal to install dependencies 
- You'll find an atached file requirement.txt

```sh
$ pip install requirement.txt
```

## Run Data Scientist Test : 

I supposed that you are already installed jupyter notebook ! 
#### 1. Download Data into directory Test :

#### 2. Rename files as follows :
Example : 
change the name of first trip data (2009) to trips2009.json and so on ! 
### 3. Done : 
Now you can use the code ! 
Every script is commented !
